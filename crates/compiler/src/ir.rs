/// A single IR instruction.

/// # SSA Form
///
/// IR instructions are always in SSA (Single Static Assignment) form and thus have an implicit
/// "output variable". Other instructions that use the output of a previous instruction will
/// reference that instruction directly via `InstId`.
///
/// In order for the IR to be well-formed, instructions are only allowed to appear *once* in an
/// entire IR, or in other words, the same `InstId` cannot be re-used either in the same block
/// or in different blocks. Also, all uses of an instruction must be "dominated" by its singular
/// definition -- in other words, all paths through the CFG (Control Flow Graph) starting with
/// `start_block` that reach any use of an instruction must always pass through its definition.
///
/// # Phi / Upsilon
///
/// SSA form requires that join points in the CFG have special instructions to select between
/// different data definitions depending on the path in the CFG that was taken. These are normally
/// called "phi functions" and are described by Cytron et al. here:
///
/// <https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/115372.115320>
///
/// We use a slight modification to this system here. Instead of "phi" instructions referencing the
/// instructions they select between, instead a separate "upsilon" instruction writes to a "shadow
/// variable" that is present for every `Phi` instruction. The `ShadowVar` type is the unique
/// identifier for this shadow variable in a single phi instruction.
///
/// This phi / upsilon SSA form was invented by Filip Pizlo is more deeply explained in this
/// document (where he calls it "pizlo-form"):
///
/// <https://gist.github.com/pizlonator/79b0aa601912ff1a0eb1cb9253f5e98d>
///
/// In order for the IR to be well-formed, any `ShadowVar` identifier must be unique and owned by
/// a *single* `Phi` instruction. These shadow variables are Single Static *Use*, they are used
/// only once by a unique `Phi` instruction. Additionally, all paths through the CFG starting with
/// `start_block` that may reach a `Phi` instruction must have an `Upsilon` that assigns to that
/// `Phi`'s shadow variable to ensure that it has a defined value.
///
/// # Scopes
///
/// Several IR instructions operate on some resource that is shared between instructions. These
/// resources require bounded regions of the CFG where the resource state can be statically
/// determined, and these regions are called IR "scopes".
///
/// Specific scopes may have further restrictions, but all scopes share a number of rules:
///
/// * Scopes must have *exactly one* open instruction.
/// * Scopes may have any number of close instructions, including zero. Any function exit implicitly
///   closes all scopes.
/// * All instructions which operate on a scope must fall within the live region of that scope. The
///   CFG region between the single open instruction and any close is referred as the scope's "live
///   region", or that the scope is "open" within this region.
/// * All incoming edges to a block must be in the same state for every scope, either all open or
///   all closed for that scope. In simpler terms, this means that every region in the CFG must be
///   deterministically either open or closed for every scope. This rule also implies that it is not
///   possible to re-open a scope without closing it first, because if the block is reachable, it
///   has an incoming edge where it must be closed, so every incoming edge must be closed.
/// * All explicit scope closures must occur when a scope is open. Since we know that nowhere in
///   the CFG can be both open and closed depending on the path taken, this simply means that there
///   cannot be a "dead" close instruction that always closes an already closed scope.
///
/// Primarily these rules enable correct and more efficient codegen where scopes represent a
/// resource with strict rules about obtaining and releasing it, but they also serve a second
/// important purpose. The rules may be sometimes more restrictive than strictly required for the
/// resource in question, but the rules help to verify that generated IR is correct in complex
/// situations. It is very easy to accidentally generate IR for loops that places a scope open
/// close on the inside rather than the outside of a loop or vice versa. Since these rules can be
/// statically verified, this helps to catch what would otherwise be very hard to track down IR
/// generation bugs.
///
/// # Variables
///
/// IR "variables" represent notionally heap allocated values that are an escape hatch for SSA form.
/// Each registered `Variable` references a unique variable, and `GetVariable` and `SetVariable`
/// instructions read from and write to these variables.
///
/// The compiler will generate IR that uses these variables to represent actual variables in code,
/// and will rely on IR optimization to convert them to SSA form, potentially by inserting `Phi` and
/// `Upsilon` instructions.
///
/// Normally, *all* owned IR variables can be converted into SSA form in this way, but any variables
/// that are prototype-level statics or shared across parent / child closures will not be converted
/// to SSA form. These shared variables that remain after optimization will instead be represented
/// by VM "heap" variables, allowing them to be shared across closures.
///
/// Variables have a "scope" as described above, their scope is opened with `OpenVariable` and
/// closed with `CloseVariable`. There are very few additional rules:
///
/// * Static and upvalue variables can be used anywhere in their containing function and in
///   well-formed IR must have neither `OpenVariable` nor `CloseVariable` instructions. These
///   variables are always considered open for the entire CFG of the function that contains
///   them.
/// * The `Closure` instruction is considered to use every variable that the child function
///   references as an upvalue.
///
/// # Nested Scopes
///
/// "Nested Scopes" have similar rules to regular scopes but are more restrictive. The purpose of
/// nested scopes is to guard access in the IR to some single shared resource, ensuring that only
/// one logical "section" of the IR is operating on this resource at a time.
///
/// There are two kinds of nested scopes: "this" scopes and "call" scopes; "this" scopes guard the
/// `this` and `other` registers, and "call" scopes guard the stack.
///
/// Nested scopes come with some additional rules:
///
/// * All instructions which operate on a scope must NOT be within the open region of some other,
///   different scope.
/// * As an exception to the above rule, nested scopes, like their name implies, may be *strictly*
///   nested. "Strictly nested" means that the live range of an inner scope must lie *entirely*
///   within the live range of the outer scope. In simpler terms, this means that the inner open
///   must always come after the outer open, and any inner close must always come before any outer
///   close (or they can be closed at the same time due to a function exit). This exception to
///   the above rule only applies to the *innermost* open scope, an outer scope may not have any
///   instructions which fall in the live region of an inner scope.
///
/// The reasoning for this rule is that since these scopes guard a single shared resource, any
/// overlapping access of this resource would cause unrelated sections of IR to interfere. Nesting
/// is explicitly allowed becuase open instructions are meant to save the previous state of the
/// resource and the close instructions are meant to restore it. As long as scopes are strictly
/// nested, then the state of the resource will be saved and restored in such a way that an outer
/// scope should not be able to observe if an inner scope was opened and closed inside.
